# Gym Member Behavior and Engagement Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing gym member behavior and engagement patterns using data analytics. The goal is to understand how different factors such as age, membership type, workout intensity, and visit frequency impact customer engagement, retention, and overall gym performance.

The analysis follows the Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics framework to provide actionable business insights.

**Objectives**
